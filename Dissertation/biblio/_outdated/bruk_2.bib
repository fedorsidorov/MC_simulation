@article{Bruk2016,
abstract = {It was shown that the proposed earlier method of dry electron-beam resist etching (DEBER) could be used for direct formation of micro- A nd nanostructures with well-rounded profile. Vertical resolution is about 1 nm and exposure doses for PMMA is only 0.1-1 $\mu$C/cm2. Special features of the method that should be taken into account are analyzed. Also results of the pattern transfer to silicon and tungsten are presented. It appears that the method could be used for numerous applications, for example in optics, optoelectronics and 3D-structuring.},
